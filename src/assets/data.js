    `All he wanted was a candy bar. It didn't seem like a difficult request to comprehend, but the clerk remained frozen and didn't seem to want to honor the request. It might have had something to do with the gun pointed at his face.`,
    `I was sitting in a parking lot, trying to get some fresh air. I was thinking about what I could do to make this parking spot more pleasant for others. I decided to take a deep breath and step out of the car. As I stepped out of the car, I heard a loud bang coming from behind. I looked up and saw a man in a black jacket and a red shirt running towards me. He was pointing his gun at me and told me that he was looking for something to do with his gun pointing at him.`,
    `The bowl was filled with fruit. It seemed to be an overabundance of strawberries, but it also included blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and banana slices. This was the meal Sarah had every morning to start her day since she could remember. Why she decided to add chocolate as an option today was still a bit of a surprise, but she had been in the process of deciding she wanted to change her routine. This was a baby step to begin that start.`,
    `Frank knew there was a correct time and place to reveal his secret and this wasn't it. The issue was that the secret might be revealed despite his best attempt to keep it from coming out. At this point, it was out of his control and completely dependant on those around him who also knew the secret. They wouldn't purposely reveal it, or at least he believed that, but they could easily inadvertently expose it. It was going to be a long hour as he nervously eyed everyone around the table hoping they would keep their mouths shut.`,
    `As she sat watching the world go by, something caught her eye. It wasn't so much its color or shape, but the way it was moving. She squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going, but it didn't help. As she continued to stare into the distance, she didn't understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body. She felt like she should get up and run. If only she could make out what it was. At that moment, she comprehended what it was and where it was heading, and she knew her life would never be the same.

    `The room was filled with people. Sarah, her friends, and her family were all sitting around a table, the table covered in a big bowl of fruit. Sarah was the only one who could see the bowl. She had a clear idea of what she wanted to eat and why, but she couldn't see why it was important to her. `,
    `Sarah couldn't see why it was important to her. She had been thinking about her favorite fruit, the strawberries, and she had been trying to make her day better by eating more of them. She had been hoping that by eating more strawberries, she could get a better appetite and make her day more enjoyable. But she couldn't see why she should be trying to make her day better by eating more strawberries.`,
    `She decided to take a deep breath and step out of the bowl. As she stepped out of the bowl, she heard a loud bang coming from behind. She looked up and saw a man in a black jacket and a red shirt running towards her. He was pointing his gun at her and told her that he was looking for something to do with his gun pointing at her. `,
    `Sarah looked at the man and saw that he was a friend of her. He had been playing with her and had been helping her with her daily tasks. Sarah felt a warm glow in her heart and a desire to help him. She decided to help him by taking a deep breath and stepping out of the bowl. As she stepped out of the bowl, she heard a loud bang coming from behind.`,
    `The headphones were on. They had been utilized on purpose. She could hear her mom yelling in the background, but couldn't make out exactly what the yelling was about. That was exactly why she had put them on. She knew her mom would enter her room at any minute, and she could pretend that she hadn't heard any of the previous yelling.`,
    `Cake or pie? I can tell a lot about you by which one you pick. It may seem silly, but cake people and pie people are really different. I know which one I hope you are, but that's not for me to decide. So, what is it? Cake or pie?`,
    `I was sitting in a parking lot, trying to get some fresh air. I was thinking about what I could do to make this parking spot more pleasant for others. I decided to take a deep breath and step out of the car. As I stepped out of the car, I heard a loud bang coming from behind.
